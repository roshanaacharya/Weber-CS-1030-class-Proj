    <h2>World's First Programmer- 1843 AD</h2>
    <p>Ada Lovelace was born in London, England in 1815 and passed away in 1852. 
        She is known as the world's first programmer. According to my research, 
        it was Ada's mother who encouraged her to pursue mathematics and science. 
        She worked with Charles Babbage, who designed the Analytical Engine in 1843. 
        The potential of the Analytical Engine to perform calculations beyond arithmetic caught Ada's attention, 
        and she started taking notes on the subject, which are considered to be the first computer program ever written.</p>
    <p>The work done by Ada Lovelace laid the foundation for modern computer programming. 
        The fact that she speculated about the possibility of composing music, creating graphics, 
        and other operations using the Analytical Engine was a significant contribution to the 
        history of computing, which led us to the modern era of artificial intelligence, 
        data analysis, and other advancements. One of the most inspiring things is that she accomplished 
        this in a time when women had limited opportunities.</p>
