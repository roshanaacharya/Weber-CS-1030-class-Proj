  <h2>My Internet Setup</h2>
    <img class="yub" src="images/tplink.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="first">As I live in University Village, my primary source of accessing the internet is through Eduroam. I couldn't find any router or modem here and I'm unsure about the access points too. So I'll be writing about the Internet setup I used to have at my home back in Nepal.</p>
      <p>At home, I used to have a router and modem combination to ensure a reliable internet connection. The router and modem combination I have at home is TP-Link AC1750 Smart WiFi Router which provides the strong signal strength reaches every corner of my house, providing fast and stable internet access for all my devices.</p>
      <p>Since the Internet service provider company bought the router for me I didn't buy but If you are interested in getting a similar router, you can find it <a class="a" href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AC1750-Smart-WiFi-Router/dp/B079JD7F7G/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2N1HRYKLTARY8&keywords=ONT+G-1425-GA+-+DPR+Nokia+router&qid=1685915702&sprefix=ont+g-1425-ga+-+dpr+nokia+router%2Caps%2C147&sr=8-3" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Talking about Internet service provider, I used to be connected to the internet through Worldlink, one of the fastest-growing internet service providers in Nepal. Worldlink offers high-speed internet with a download speed of 250 Mbps and an upload speed of 300 Mbps, ensuring a seamless online experience. I could effortlessly stream my favorite shows, engage in online gaming, and collaborate on work projects without any lag or interruptions.Even if I had problems arise the support teams used to resolve the issues.</p>
