    <h2>Acer Predator Triton 500</h2>
    <p>The Acer predator triton 500 can be used for various purposes like video editing, 3D modeling, animation, watching movies and etc. but mainly it is used for gaming. Since this is a gaming laptop, it would be a crime not to mention the gaming capability of the device. You would get outstanding perfromance if you run a couple of games in various settings with the Turbo mode on and GPU overclocking in the Extreme profile to get the best result. However running games will increase the temperature, but, it will not trouble you that much. The keys will get heated up if you go for a long gaming session.</p>

    <p>The acer predator Triton 500 is equipped with a sizable battery, but due to its focus on performance, it may not provide extended battery life. For general usage scenario, the battery life may be longer, ranging from 4 to 6 hours.
      As with the other Predator laptops, the Triton 500 comes with the PredatorSense app. You can access it with the help of the dedicated key right below the power button class="button" or through the windows menu.the layout is pretty much standard, however, you don’t get a Numpad.

There are no dedicated buttons for End and Home, however, they are tied up with the function keys.
